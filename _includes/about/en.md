##### My Trajectory

- 1996 --- XinJinghao.Init()
- 2002 --- Shuanghu Elementary School, a life of mischief
- 2009 --- Yubei Middle School, sudden awakening
- 2015 --- Jilin University, my youth, not without scars
- 2016 --- Met her, well...
- 2019 --- Shanghai Jiao Tong University, embarking on the PhD journey
- 2023 --- Nanyang Technological University, as a visting student in Singapore, dialoguing with myself in solitude
- 2024 --- Back to SJTU, preparing for graduation, time to show my true skills
- 2025 --- Get married with her. 8 years.
